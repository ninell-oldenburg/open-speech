# OpenSpeech Project

This is a program to make speech visible. Through a GUI you can record a sentence and get the visible analysis of it afterwards. 
Current state of the art: visualizes pitch, loudness (in decibel) and voice quality (namely: if the utterances is whispered
or not wispered).

# Use

Download all the .py files. You can make your own recording or text me to get sample recordings. Open the program in the terminal
using 'python3 gui.py' and the GUI will open. It comes with instructions (in German). 

# Dependecies

You need Python 3.x, numpy, matplotlib, ffmpeg, sounddevice, tkinter, portaudio, pyaudio, parselmouth.

# Share

# Paperwork
